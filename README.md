# Structured-programming-interfacing-project

The program was written in C programming language. The program prompts user for current, resistance,
inductance and capacitance measurements. The system then generates 200 pseudo-random frequency inputs
and calculate impedance and voltage based on the generated frequencies. The voltages will then be plotted
in a web page and the maximum and minimum voltages are indicated in the plot. The C program was written
to generate the design of the web page using HTML and CSS.
